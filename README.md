# clj-strava

A library that provides functions for consuming the Strava API V3.

Currently only auth and the GET methods are available.  Not all resources have been tested.
The library is currently in development and provided functions may change at any time.


# Requirements

* [Clojure 1.7 - 1.9](https://clojure.org/community/downloads) `brew install clojure`
* [core.async](https://github.com/clojure/core.async) last tested against 0.4.474

## Usage

Leiningen dependency:

    [ekimber/clj-strava "0.1.1"]

Place your secret in a `.lein-env` file `{:strava-secret "your secret" :strava-id 1234}` in the project root,
or supply environment variables `STRAVA_SECRET` and `STRAVA_ID`.

You also want to collect your public access token which you can add to .lein-env or simply store as a def within your clj file.

NS require :

    (:require [clj-strava.api :as strava]
              [clojure.core.async :refer [<!!]])

To acquire a token, obtain a code as described here: http://strava.github.io/api/v3/oauth/

The code is obtained from the response during [Strava's OAuth2 authentication](https://developers.strava.com/docs/authentication/) process. This is a good [write up about how to get this code](https://yizeng.me/2017/01/11/get-a-strava-api-access-token-with-write-permission/).

## Get the Authorization Code

example request url:
```
https://www.strava.com/oauth/authorize?client_id=28964&response_type=code&redirect_uri=http://localhost/exchange_token&approval_prompt=force&scope=view_private,write
```

In your frontend ClojureScript view, you need create a link to this authorization page.

```
(def client-id "your-client-id")
(def redirect-uri "http://localhost:3000/api/strava/token")
(def response-type "code")
(def scope "view_private,write")
(def approval-prompt "force")
(def strava-authorize-url
  (str "https://www.strava.com/oauth/authorize?"
       "client_id=" client-id "&"
       "response_type=" response-type "&"
       "redirect_uri=" redirect-uri "&"
       "approval_prompt=" approval-prompt "&"
       "scope=" scope))

[:a {:href strava-authorize-url} "Authorize Strava"]
```

Then, from your web server Clojure app, you need to setup this "/api/strava/token" route to handle the response and update your user record adding the code.

```
(GET "/api/strava/token" request
"handle the strava request, grab the code and store it with the user who granted access then redirect back to your home page"
  (update-user-with-code (get-in request [:params :code]))
  (redirect "/"))
```

From this response, extract the code param `bd12d017f3674ad65f5ea9712cf9c29d5b807112`

## Use the Authorization Code

Then we can swap the code for an access token:

```
(def public-strava-token
    (env :strava-public-token))

(defn get-activities []
  "this GET route handler will return your json activities from Strava"
  (fn []
    (let [access-token (strava/access-token public-strava-token)]
      (<!! (strava/activities access-token {"per_page 5"})))))
```

Pass in the access token to the API functions.  They require a map of URL replacements where appropriate
and additional query params can be passed in an optional map.  Keywordized JSON is returned on an async channel.

Example: list activities

    (<!! (strava/activities access-token {"per_page 5"}))

Example: list athlete's KOMs

    (<!! (strava/athlete-koms access-token {:id 490421} {"per_page" 5}))
